# Hi, I'm Tyler! :wave:

Welcome! This is a multi-purpose profile that I'll use as both a portfolio and version control for projects.

## About Me:
I'm a Computer Information Systems student and tech support specialist located in North Carolina. I'm super passionate about learning all I can about tech, not only for the workforce but also for my own personal interest.

I often create one-off scripts for fun, usually in Python, either for practice or just to see if I can put an idea to life. [(Click here to see)](https://github.com/tybozzy/small_personal_projects)

I also think it's important to include examples of completed class work to show what's in my cirriculum. [(Click here to see)](https://github.com/tybozzy/class_projects)

There might be more miscellaneous projects that don't meet the above categories that I'll create. They'll get uploaded and updated as I work on them in their own respository.

## What I'm working on now:
- Mostly just focusing on school and writing small scripts/programs in my free time!

## Future Projects:
- Portfolio/professional Website
    - Place to display completed and in-progress projects
    - Also for practice with backend, frontend, hosting, and design
- Art Projects
    - Using microcontrollers (Arduino, RPi, ESP32, etc.) to create physical art installations
